### Based on the chart, the people from the first class were the oldest ones while the 3rd class passengers were the youngest ones. Ergo, wealth is obtained at a later age. ###

for x in [1,2,3]: 
    train['Age'][train['Pclass'] == x].plot(kind='kde', figsize=(10,5))
plt.title('Class with regards to Age')
plt.legend(['1st','2nd','3rd'])

### Please note the 0 and 1 curbs represent death vs survival rates. ###
#### Also at first glance, most unfortunate were the 3rd class people while the 1st class had the highest survival rate. ####

plt.legend(['1st','2nd','3rd'])

```

# Surviving people with regards to class, as bar graph representation. #
### Obs.: compared to the KDE graph , the bar chart focuses only on the people who survived, therefore the impression is that there was little difference between 1st and 3rd class survival counts. In reality, given that 3rd class passengers were a much bigger group, their survival rate is much lower than presented here. ###


```python

plt.show()
```


![png](output_29_0.png)


# Now a round a comparison of survivals by ticket/social class status and genders #
### Small conclusion: if general consensus is that women live longer than men, in this case obviously rich women have double chances of living longer than their less fortunate peers. ###
#### Please keep in mind, that the value 0 represents the ones who died in the Titanic incident, while 1 stands for the survivors. ####
